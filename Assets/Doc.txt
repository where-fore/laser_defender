design
~~~~~~~~~~
controls are floaty
give enemies a better chance of reaching the end of the screen, instead of expecting them to die before the wave is finished - this will have the waves overlap and keep the player on their toes
have a better tutorial - a wave that makes you move vertically, a wave that makes you move horizontally, a wave that makes you zig zig etc.
avoid the flappy bird problem where the first waves are boring and it takes forever to get to the challenge
    > spawn waves based partially on score? spawn [easy] if score <10000
        > this makes score a malus to pick up
            > could promote interesting strats


content ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
big enemy that shoots big lasers, destroy smaller enemies - a boss
enemies that reflect bullets
enemies that spawn enemies/bullets on death
when any ship dies, have a chance to shoot a bullet (to prevent staying still)
have random asteroids that come in and destroy both players and enemies



FX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Playerdeath vfx - bigger, lasts longer
Playerhit vfx - maybe green
enemy hit vfx - more visible(higher alpha)
playerdeah sfx - not bad
easier to tell when player gets hit - red flash, camera shake, sfx or all of the above
healthbar on bottom of screen?




code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
change PlayClipAtPoint to Instantiate(clipPlayer, ..., ...) and have prefabbed audiosources with prerouted mixer groups
