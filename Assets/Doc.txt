controls are floaty

vertical bullets (cylinders) will make the player have to use the vertical axis

change PlayClipAtPoint to Instantiate(clipPlayer, ..., ...) and have prefabbed audiosources with prerouted mixer groups

better player death sfx

when ships die, have a chance to shoot a bullet (to prevent staying still)
